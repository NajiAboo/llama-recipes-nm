As higher risk of future coronary events rather than elevated LDL-C is the primary indication to initiate lipid-lowering treatment in CKD patients, follow- up monitoring of LDL-C (after an initial measurement) will not usually be required for many patients especially given normal variability in LDL-C over time, which reduces the clinical utility of follow-up measurements.21",
